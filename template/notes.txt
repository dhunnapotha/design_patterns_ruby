- Parent defines the signature (Newsletter::Generator - header, content)
- Common logic will be present in the parent (Newsletter::Generator - render)
- Inherited classes implement logic (for eg: Newsletter::HTML - header, content)
- This is Behavioral pattern
- Heavily relies in inheritance
- Basically, the caller directly calls the required inherited class for Newslett::HTML.new.render

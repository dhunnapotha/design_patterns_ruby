- Not clear at all
- A bit confusing on when to use adapter pattern and when to use strategy pattern

- As far as my understanding goes:
- If an adaptee format is not understandable to the client, have an adapter which modifies the adaptees output into the required  syntax and gives it to the client. That's it
- This is a structural pattern!

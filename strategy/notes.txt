- Define a strategy. All strategy class should implement that strategy, for eg: .execute should return String when called
- Pass the context to a strategy
- Use a template strategy if it is a simple case relied on inheritance. If it is a complex case, strategy pattern might work better
- A good example of strategy pattern is authentication - facebook login / twitter login as long as they implement oauth contrat
